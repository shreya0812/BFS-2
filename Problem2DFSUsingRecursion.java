// Time Complexity : O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
// Space Complexity : O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach:
// - Use DFS to traverse the binary tree while keeping track of each nodeâ€™s level and parent.
// - If both x and y are found at the same level but have different parents, they are cousins.
// - If either condition fails, they are not cousins.
