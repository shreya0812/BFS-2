// Time Complexity : O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
// Space Complexity : O(n), for the queue used in BFS (in worst case, when the last level has n/2 nodes).
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach:
// BFS (level order traversal) based solution
// We use a queue to process the tree level by level.
// The `size` variable tells us how many nodes exist at the current level.
// It helps ensure we only process nodes from one level at a time, even as we keep adding nodes from the next level to the queue.
// At each level, we process nodes from right to left by enqueuing `right` child before `left`.
// We add the first node we encounter at each level to the result list â€” that node is the rightmost one from the current level's perspective.
