// Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
// Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case (due to stack storage for nodes, parents, and levels).
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach:
//Iterative approach
// - Use three stacks to simulate DFS: one for nodes, one for their parents, and one for their levels.
// - Track x and y's parent and depth as you traverse.
// - At the end, check if they are at the same level and have different parents â†’ then they're cousins.
